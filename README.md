This C code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers using recursion and a static variable to store intermediate results.

Here's a description of what the code does:
1. It prompts the user to enter two integers.
2. It calls the `find_lcm` function, passing the entered integers as arguments.
3. The `find_lcm` function calculates the LCM of the two integers recursively.
4. It uses a static variable `temp` to store the current value being checked for LCM.
5. If `temp` is divisible by both integers `a` and `b`, it returns `temp` as the LCM.
6. If not, it increments `temp` and recursively calls itself until the LCM is found.
7. Finally, the calculated LCM is displayed to the user.

This code demonstrates the use of recursion to solve a mathematical problem and can be useful for educational purposes or as part of a larger application involving mathematical computations.

The description provides an overview of the code's functionality and approach, making it easier for readers to understand its purpose and implementation when browsing the GitHub repository's README section.
